    "observation": "The assigned block range (b1231-b1317) contains VAT warranties (b1231-b1244), pension transfer provisions/Schedule 14 (b1245-b1306), and signature blocks (b1307-b1317). The main governing law, jurisdiction, and boilerplate provisions are located OUTSIDE this range: governing law clause (b680), jurisdiction clause (b681), third party rights referencing UK Act (b658), and interest rate clause referencing Bank of England (b651). The pension provisions in the assigned range contain numerous UK-specific statutory references (Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004, Pension Schemes Act 1993, Finance Act 2004) that would require substantive legal adaptation beyond the scope of a simple jurisdiction change.",
